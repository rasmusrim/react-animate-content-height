# react-animate-content-height
A component which will enable animating the height of a component based on the actual content. That means you don't have to know anything about the height.

That means you don't have to calculate the height or anything in order to animate it. This library will do those calculations for you.

# Usage
```typescript jsx
import { AnimateHeight } from "react-animate-content-height";

<AnimateHeight>
    Content with varying size    
</AnimateHeight>
```
